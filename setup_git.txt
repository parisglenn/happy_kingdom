Get Git
http://git-scm.com/download/mac
Install the package
Then start/restart your terminal
Type: git in the terminal and make sure you see a list of commands

Setup Git
Create and navigate to folder ~/Documents/dev/git
type: git init
Add your name and email to the account by following the steps below:
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
I think this is only used for private repositories, but it doesn't hurt to have support for that set up.

Get the repo
type: git clone git://github.com/erikosmond/happy_kingdom.git
cd into ./happy_kingdom directory

Update repo info
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:erikosmond/happy_kingdom.git

Generate SSH key
For me, there was a little inconsistency with the instruction in this link, but it's still very straight forward.  My .ssh file existed, but it didn't have the document they wanted me to back up, so if you don't have that document either, don't worry about copying and backing it up.  In short, you can probably skip step 2, but take a look at it just incase.  
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys
paste the ssh key in an email to me and I'll add you to the repo

Try Git
At this point it makes sense to run through this quick tutorial
http://try.github.com/levels/1/challenges/1

Participate
After you change or add something to the happy kingdom directory, add and commit the file(s) like in the tutorial above.
If you put a new file in the directory, type: git add <your_file>
If you just change a file (or files), type: git commit -m "a message saying what you changed"
In both cases you need to do a commit before you can push to the remote repository 
To push the changes or updates to the repository, type: git push -u origin master
